- suggestions are on, so feel free to comment about anything that looks wrong or is missing

##Sept 15: Intro

why is concurrency important?

- e.g. phone with 2-8 cores
- before they could try improving clock speed, power hungry, overheating
- could try really long pipeline to improve clock frequency, but there can be stalling and flushing which delays more stuff
- multiple cores let multiple threads run at same time to be more efficient

(then he told us a bunch of stories and it was fun)

###Intro Slides


##Sept 17

Review of executing a sequential program:

- figure out which instruction to run with PC that stores the memory address of instruction
- we store program code in a specific area of memory
 - so we don't accidentally run other stuff
 - usually code remains the same after we compile, so we can make it read only, and avoid running code we don't want to execute
 - security problem - if you can allow code executed from anywhere, people can put code in your stack, and then you execute random stuff that's bad (not important for this course)
- we have data stored in registers
- move/load/store instructions that can move stuff between registers and memory
- global variables are in program data
- local variables are stored in the stack, stack pointer 
- CPU fetches and executes


###Threads and Concurrency: slides 1-17

[Context switch example slides](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/idj4uqwlfyu2uf/hbqmn85hst0c8/ieogtuuip7x/context_switch_example.pdf)

- thread 1 is running because thread 2 performed a voluntary context switch
- timer interrupt!
- PC set to interrupt handler
- save trap frame
- interrupt handling
- if we decide to switch threads, we do thread yield and thread switch, and switch frame - round robin scheduler says to go to thread 2
- restore switch frame in thread 2
- return from thread yield, and continue running thread 2

##Sept 22 and 24 and 29 (I stopped taking down dates for a bit)

Review: 

When is there context switch?

- voluntary
- involuntary
- ready queue
- thread is done running

###Threads and Concurrency: slides 18-24

###Syncronization: slides 1-9

[Concurrency example slides](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/idj4uqwlfyu2uf/hbqmn85hst0c8/ievmnot7652c/concurrency_example.pdf)

- thread2 pops the element that thread1 saved, and frees it so it doesn't even exist anymore
- when we context switch back to thread1, it tries to access element->next which might fail because element's memory has been freed 
- it might not even crash it could just do bad things 
- we decrement the size of the list again (even though only one's been freed), we free again!


###Syncronization: slides 13-17


bathroom analogy

- only one person in stall at a time
- first you check if the door is locked
- if the stall is locked, you don't go in - you wait
- once they're done, they unlock
- first thing you do when you go in, you lock so no one else will come in

convert to code (building a spin lock - this one is broken though)

	while(lock == 1) {}
	lock = 1 
	....dostuff... 
	lock = 0

but what if there are multiple threads running? they both see it's unlocked and access at same time (if there's a context switch right before lock=1)


###Syncronization: slides 18-28


we have a problem - metaphor: sleeping beauty (first thread) waiting for prince (second thread)

- before sleeping beauty goes to sleep, she goes off and does some stuff
-  "I don't even know how this fairy tale goes - why do I try to do this metaphor"
- prince charming arrives, no one is there, so he leaves and continues
- sleeping beauty comes back and goes to bed - but then no prince comes to wake her up
- "we go from a fairy tale to a shakespearean tragedy. not good."

###Syncronization: slides 29-36

[Why the order for semaphore P is so important (and why it isn't FIFO)](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/idj4uqwlfyu2uf/hbqmn85hst0c8/if5mj3aguwy3/synchronization_example.pdf)


## Oct 1

[Mutual Exclusion vs. Synchronization & Wait Channel Review & Semaphore Review](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/idj4uqwlfyu2uf/hbqmn85hst0c8/if8ktc8gr6o2/synchronization_review.pdf)

Mutual Exclusion vs. Synchronization

- Mutual exclusion: Ensures that a shared object can only be accessed by one thread at a time
- synchronization is about establishing timing/order relationships among threads
- mutual exclusion is a type of synchronization problem, but can be solved simpler

Wait Channel Review 

- the lock is important so we don't modify the wchan structure at the same time from different places
- wakeone and wakeall aquires and releases wc_lock on their own
- wc_sleep does not acquire the lock on its own, must explicitly call wchan_lock before calling wchan_sleep (reasons for this on the slides, sumarized here)
 - wait channels are amost never used on their own
 - usually paired with a state variable that has its own lock
 - to ensure the state variable is modified together with wait channel, the thread has to always hold at least one lock, and has to release all locks before sleeping
 - so we lock the wchan before releasing the state variable lock, and therefore the wchan can't release the lock itself

Semaphore Review

- counter is never negative
- P blocks when counter is 0
- Not FIFO ordering
 - e.g. it gets woken up, put in ready queue, by the time it gets to front of queue it's blocked again
- must check sempahore count after woken up - hence while loop


###Syncronization: slides 37-48


##Oct 6

[Deadlock example](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/idj4uqwlfyu2uf/hbqmn85hst0c8/iffphwfshl6o/deadlock_example.pdf)

Resource allocation graph

- resources point to threads that hold them, threads point to resources theyâ€™re waiting on 
- if there's a loop, we have deadlock

###Syncronization: slides 49-50

###Processes and the Kernel: slides 1-19


## Oct 8 

Assignment hints

- Cars inside
- Where cars inside are coming from/going
- Cars waiting
- if you can't go, you wait 
 - a single line of waiting cars on a single cv is bad - doesn't actually necessarily define order of when they can go, so inefficient
- cars can go from o->d that other cars are going, but it might not be a great idea because cars can continue going in that way and prevent other cars from going through the intersection

Recap of last class:

- a process is a bunch of threads, also has an address space so processes can't talk to each other
- there's kernel and user space, kernel is privileged
- to do something privileged, user space does a system call
 - special syscall instruction that brings you into privileged mode, takes parameters as registers
 - jumps to exception
 - sees we came from user space
 - switches stack pointer from user stack to kernel stack
 - saves trap frame

it's important to have kernel stack separate because 

- it has really privileged stuff - user accessing it would be a security vulnerability
- if the kernel messes up and runs out of stack space, it'd crash the kernel, but that's up to the kernel - if the user program can access it then it can crash the whole computer (we want it to only crash itself)


###Processes and the Kernel: slides 20-27

[system call example](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/idj4uqwlfyu2uf/hbqmn85hst0c8/iffpkb0ybnn8/system_call_example.pdf)

- a thread stop running from inside a kernel, so when you switch to another thread you always will switch within the kernel

###Processes and the Kernel: slides 27-32?

## Oct 12 and 14 I was at a conference

I did meet up with Bernard for some extra info on the slides, and I put those notes on the slides

###Processes and the Kernel: slides 33?-43

###Virtual Memory: slides 1-20 //// end of midterm coverage

---- during that week we reached the end of midterm coverage ----

(I will probably update these notes later to have similar content for lectures since)

## Midterm review by IA

there are lots of [past midterms](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/common/old-exams/)

- W15 is an appropriate level of difficulty (we went through it all)
- S14 is also good to look at (we went through some of it)

know:

- difference between thread_fork and fork
- what a quantum is and how scheduling works
- dirty bit means writeable (but Bernard says don't worry about it since we haven't covered it yet)

be careful what base numbers are in


## Review lecture

[review slides](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/idj4uqwlfyu2uf/hbqmn85hst0c8/igcoky4cl73h/CS350_Midterm_Review_F15.pdf)

- thread is defined as an abstraction of a program execution

what causes context switch:  

- thread yield (voluntary context switch)
- thread blocks on wait channel
- preemption (for fairness) - interrupt, goes into kernel, kernel decides if spending too much time, if too much the kernel calls thread yield

trapframe vs switchframe:

- trapframe is on kernel stack frame, generated by system call in common exception handler
- switchframe is saved when you context switch (thread_yield) -- also on kernel stack
- difference between switchframe and trapframe 
 - switchframe is voluntary
 - trapframe is involuntary
 - trapframe has to save temp registers (not guarenteed to be preserved after function call) because it was involuntary, switchframe doesn't


thread synchronization

- if all threads are working on different things, we don't need synchronization
- be able to define mutual exclusion and critical section
- volatile keyword: tells compiler to 
 - back off - don't optimize it because it might behave differently than expected
 - reload it each time we access it
 - store each time we modify it

enforcing mutual exclusion:

- on uniprocessor, disable interrupts - this doesn't work on multiprocessor where multiple threads are running at the same time
- spinlocks
 - test-and-set
 - compare-and-swap
 - load-link
 - (look up the difference between these 3!)
 - while(testandset) is inefficient because it keeps looping

potential problem with spinlocks:

- uses lots of resources without needing to - so much spinning
- solution: avoid spinning by going to sleep on a wait channel (what we did in A1)

###BIG HINT: review your assignments

###virtual memory will be a big part of the midterm



## Nov 3

[Assignment tips](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/idj4uqwlfyu2uf/hbqmn85hst0c8/igiawxcpjsan/assignment_2b.pdf)

- this assignment lets us run multiple programs at the same time
- in the menu we use to run programs, we can't pass parameters, execv lets us pass paramters
- taking a look at runprogram:
 - it replaces data/memory/code/stack with a new program specified in first parameter
 - array is terminated by a null pointer so we can tell where it ends (b/c we don't pass length and this is C)
 - the menu has to do a lot of this work already, so a lot of this code already exists - check out runprogram
 - file systems - there are no file systems assignments in this course, so don't worry too much about how that works for now
 - as_create instead of as_copy (as_copy copies from parent, but there's no previous adress space to copy from)
 - program starts off with empty stack, pointer points to top of stack


![diagram on board](elf_a2b.jpg)
What load elf does (don't need to know for a2 but we do for a3)


so what do we have to do?

- in the slide for execv the grey points are the ones we mostly just copy 
- parameters: path to program name, array of strings
- these parameters are pointers to somewhere in user space
 - pointer in user space could be null (don't dereference)
 - TLB still has the right address space, so that's good
 - problem: the user could send pointers to stuff in kernel space - the user can't access it, but now the kernel can access sensitive date for the user (bad!) --- use copyin/copyout to avoid this
- so count how many addresses there are, copy program path into the kernel
- when we make function calls, we pass arguments on the stack - similarily here we want to put the arguments on the stack

tips

- use USERSTACK instead of 0x8....
- check out common mistakes on the slides - and don't make them! :p
- we can't put two 4 byte things back to back in the stack, it won't recognize it as 2 different things, so we have to round up
- allocate enough space you need (backward), then write forwards (e.g. allocate 6 characters from top of stack then put h e l l o \0, ending at the top of the stack)
- TIP: get it working without argument passing first, argument passing is tricky so make sure the rest works first (pointer stuff is tricky)
